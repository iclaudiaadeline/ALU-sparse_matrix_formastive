# Sparse Matrix Operations

This Python project implements operations on sparse matrices, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. To optimize performance and memory usage, only non-zero elements are stored and operated on.


## 🧠 Features

* Load sparse matrices from files in a custom format
* Perform:

  * ✅ Matrix Addition
  * ✅ Matrix Subtraction
  * ✅ Matrix Multiplication
  

## 📄 Input File Format

Each input file should be formatted

## Usage

- clone this repository to you local pc
- check the format of input file  that located in  sample_inputs folder
- feel free to add any oyther input files in that folder as long as they follow the format
- save and run the file

## ⚠ Error Handling

* Invalid file format raises 
* Mismatched dimensions during addition or subtraction raise ValueError
* Mismatched dimensions for multiplication raise `ValueError

## 📌 Requirements

* Python 3.x


This project is Based on data structures and matrix operations using Python.
